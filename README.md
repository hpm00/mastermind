Project #6 from Ruby Course 

How to play: Player plays against computer and chooses to be code-maker or code-breaker. As a code-maker, player creates a 4-number combination from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The computer then has 12 turns to correctly guess the chosen combination. As a code-breaker, the computer creates the 4-number combination and the player has 12 turns to correctly guess the combination. 

Throughout the game, there will be some form of feedback given. A white peg represents the correct number chosen, but it is in the wrong position. A colored peg represents the correct number and position.
