TheOdinProject

Project #6 from Ruby Course 

How to play: Player plays against computer and chooses to be code-maker or code-breaker. As a code-maker, player creates a 4-number combination from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The computer then has 12 turns to correctly guess the chosen combination. As a code-breaker, the computer creates the 4-number combination and the player has 12 turns to correctly guess the combination. Throughout the game, there will be some form of feedback given. 


Update: The feedback isn't perfect. It fails to be precise in one instance. I am currently trying different ways to tweak my code to account for this. This is why the project is not published at the moment. However, the project is about 98% complete.
